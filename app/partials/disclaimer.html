TripAdvisor LLC is not a booking agent or tour operator, and does not charge any service fees to users of our site. Our partners (airlines and booking agents) who list airfare and travel packages on TripAdvisor are required by law to include all fees and surcharges in their listed prices. Examples include the Federal September 11th Security Fee, international departure and arrival taxes and fees, federal excise tax, and other service, handling and miscellaneous fees and surcharges. When you book with one of our partners, please be sure to check their site for a full disclosure of all applicable fees as required by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Airfares are generally quoted per person in USD unless otherwise noted.

For your convenience, TripAdvisor LLC calculates an average price for each hotel, which is based on the rates of available rooms obtained from our booking partners. For any travel packages or deals listed, TripAdvisor LLC does not guarantee any specific rates or prices. In addition, average hotel prices are updated nightly and displayed in your preferred currency using prevailing conversion rates. Since these converted prices are estimates, please check with the booking site for the exact amount and currency.

Furthermore, TripAdvisor LLC makes no guarantees for availability of prices advertised on our site. Listed prices may require a stay of a particular length or have blackout dates, qualifications or restrictions.
